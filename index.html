        <p>Hi, I'm Chloe. I have travelled far and wide across the world. In the desperation of the Blitz, I carried the
          burden of 200 lives for 10 days. I was shot down over Yugoslavia, near the Hungarian border, by a Serbian
          fighter who rammed into my plane at an altitude of 1,500ft. <br><br>
          
          It was the final violation in a series of offences which would include one in September last year, when I
          caught a Turkish plane with 10 gallons of fuel on board to be sold on the black market. Luckily my explosives
          expert saved me, but all of my passengers were killed.<br><br>

        <p>Hi, I'm Ako. I am from mysterious land, land of warriors, warriors of love. Two years ago, my Shaolin master showed me the ways of javaScript. Since that, we had the dedication and constant practice in obscure practises of mastering the so-called 'program tent'. CSS meditations and HTML yoga have become my daily routine. The cleansing power of js will bring blessings to all of your surroundings.</p>

        <p>Ina specialises in front-end development and UI/UX design. She's an industry veteran with a long list of projects in over 100 countries. Enjoys attending events such as ReactEurope in Berlin and Mashable EU. Where she shakes hands and does fun stuff.</p>

        <p>Campbell Docherty was a tech genius As the war was drawing to a close, Docherty and a few of his colleagues created a first draft of what would become the canonical Declaration of Independence. The "father" of American computer science, Elihu Yale, was enthusiastic about it. "Docherty," he wrote in a memo, "has always had the habit of making up new things. The Declaration of Independence was certainly no exception." But more than the invention of the computer, what Docherty most loved was pure mathematical brilliance. In the fall of 1942, he sent a glowing review of one of his algorithms to Huxley, describing it as "impossible to understand."</p>
